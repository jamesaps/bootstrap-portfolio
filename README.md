# James Stott's Bootstrap Portfolio Page

## Description
This is a continuation and reimagination of a previous project page with Bootstrap 5.3.2 as the underlying framework responsible for ensuring responsiveness. The site uses semantic HTML elements where possible and achieves responsiveness and a clean and organised layout through the use of Bootstrap where possible, but makes infrequent use of media queries where native Bootstrap is not capable of solving a certain problem.

The site is designed with different device sizes in mind, with intuitive layouts automatically adjusting for devices of the following sizes:

* over 768px in width
* between 577px and 768px in width
* less than 577px in width

On hover effects are used to create interest and establish a strong sense of visual hierarchy to guide the user in navigating important parts of the portfolio.
